-- This script creates a table and populates it with
-- the number of records for each table and FileName.
-- Then populate the `Expected` column by running:
-- `python USPTOParser.py -verify`
-- Finally, verify a file or group of files run the `parser_verification.sql`
-- query and replace the filenames with the ones you want to verify.
